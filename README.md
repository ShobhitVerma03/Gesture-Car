# Gesture-Car
Our project aims to develop a gesture-based movable car model equipped with obstacle detection capabilities. The car will be controlled using hand gestures, allowing users to intuitively navigate it through its environment. With the integration of sensors and microcontrollers, the car will be capable of detecting obstacles in its path.
